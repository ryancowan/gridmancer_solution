A solution to CodeCombat.com's programming challenge: Gridmancer

The idea is to use as few rectangles as possible to cover as much
area as possible. While the floorplan doesn't change, the idea is
to solve this challenge programatically.

My solution solves this challenge in an optimal way and uses the 
smallest number of squares... 29. The squares are created with a
basic algorithm, going from bottom to top and left to right.
